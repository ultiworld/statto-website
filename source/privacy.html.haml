      # Privacy Policy

      This policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to the Statto app for iPhone & iPad and the Statto website.

      ## Information we collect
      
      The Statto app does not require any personal information from you in order to function. It does not transmit any data you enter to a web server. The only way that data can leave your device is for you to manually share an exported file or screenshot.

      Every page of the Statto website embeds a Google Analytics script that tracks information about your visit. This includes your browser's user agent and IP address. Google Analytics uses cookies to do this. For more information view the [Google Analytics privacy policy][gapp].

      ## Information usage

      We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

      We do not share any information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish the Statto website's functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many users have experienced app crashes or visited the website.

      We may disclose any information collected in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

      In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

      ## Security
      
      We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the website requires HTTPS.

      ## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

      We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your information to outside parties without your consent.

      ## Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

      We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

      ## Information for European Union Customers

      By using Statto and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

      ## International Transfers of Information

      Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

      ## Your Consent

      By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

      ## Changes to this policy

      If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:

      **April 24th, 2021:** Removed reference to the app tracking crashes with Crashlytics as it no longer does so.
