          ###Simple Player Selection

          During half-time, check how players are performing to gauge their pitch-time. Filter players by how many points they've played to see who needs to get on and who's being overworked.

          **Coming Soon:** Group players by role or line by assigning them tags like 'D-line', 'handler' or 'speedy' then easily filter players to call balanced lines that best suit the moment.

          ###Pitch-level Detail

          Draw plays on the pitch as they happen to record assists, secondary "hockey" assists, turnovers, blocks and more. Record more detail than ever with less effort than tallying on paper.

          No video footage from a muddy battle on Pitch 14? No problem. Review games back at home by scrolling through the Play By Play and see everything drawn on the pitch.

    %h2 Frequently Asked Questions

    %dl
      %dt Will Statto work on my iPhone, Android device or Windows tablet?
      %dd
        :kramdown
          Sorry, Statto is only available for the iPad at the moment. Support for the iPhone is planned for the near future! I'm afraid I don't plan to release a version for Android or Windows devices.

      %dt Why is Statto so expensive?!
      %dd
        :kramdown
          I understand, most apps on the App Store are very cheap, if not free. For niche apps like Statto such low pricing is unsustainable and even popular ones end up neglected. I want to support users and improve Statto for years.

          If you're a coach, consider asking the club or university to cover the expense. Your team might also be willing to pitch in a small amount to see their own stats.

      %dt Can I track two teams at once?
      %dd
        :kramdown
          Statto is designed to only track one team at a time. Tracking both sides of a game is too frantic to do live. If you need to track both, consider filming the game and watching it through twice.

      %dt Do the stats I track get uploaded anywhere?
      %dd
        :kramdown
          Not unless you share them yourself! Your data is all stored locally on your iPad to protect your team's privacy. There are plans to make sharing stats between teammates or publically easier in future.

      %dt I want to do my own analysis. Can I get at the raw data?
      %dd
        :kramdown
          Absolutely! You can export all of the raw stats in CSV format from inside the app. If you have any more questions about doing your own data analysis, feel free to email me at #{ link_to entity_obfuscate(data.contact.email), "mailto:#{percent_obfuscate(data.contact.email)}" }.
