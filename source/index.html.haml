    %h3 Simple Player Selection
    %p During half-time, check how players are performing to gauge their pitch-time. Filter players by how many points they’ve played to see who needs to get on and who’s being overworked.
    %p
      %strong Coming Soon:
      Group players by role or line by assigning them tags like ‘D-line’, ‘handler’ or ‘tall’ then easily filter players to call balanced lines that best suit the moment.

    %h2 Frequently Asked Questions

    %dl
      %dt Will Statto work on my iPhone, Android device or Windows tablet?
      %dd
        %p Sorry, Statto is only available for the iPad at the moment. Support for the iPhone is planned for the near future! I’m afraid I don’t plan to release a version for Android or Windows devices though.

      %dt Why is Statto so expensive?!
      %dd
        %p I understand, most apps on the App Store are very cheap, if not free. For niche apps like Statto such low pricing is unsustainable and even popular ones end up neglected. I want to support users and improve Statto for years.
        %p If you’re a coach, consider asking the club or university to cover the expense. Your teammates might also be willing to pitch in a little each season to see their own individual stats.

      %dt Can I track two teams at once?
      %dd
        %p Statto is designed to only track one team at a time. Tracking both sides of a game is too frantic to do live! If you need to track both, consider filming the game and watching it through twice.

      %dt Do the stats I track get uploaded anywhere?
      %dd
        %p Not unless you share them yourself! Your data is all stored locally on your iPad.

      %dt I want to do my own analysis. Can I get at the raw data?
      %dd
        %p Absolutely! You can export all of the raw stats in CSV format from inside the app. You can also back up the SQL file that Statto uses to store the data so you can query it yourself if you’re a nerd like me. If you have any more questions about doing your own data analysis, email me at #{ mail_to data.contact.email }.
